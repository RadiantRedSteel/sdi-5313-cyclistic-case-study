# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study  
SDI 5313 - Data Analytics  
University of Oklahoma Polytechnic Institute  

## Overview
This repository contains all SQL queries, code files, documentation, and supporting materials for the Cyclistic Case Study project completed as part of SDI 5103 Data Analytics. The project is organized into four milestones:

1. **Milestone 1:** Business Understanding & Analytical Planning  
2. **Milestone 2:** Data Preparation & SQL-Based Processing  
3. **Milestone 3:** Exploratory Analysis & Visualization  
4. **Milestone 4:** Storytelling, Recommendations & Presentation  

The goal of the project is to analyze historical bike-share data to understand behavioral differences between *casual riders* and *annual members*, and to use those insights to inform strategies that could increase annual memberships.

## Expected Use Tools
- **SQL**
- **R** 
- **Spreadsheet tools** (Excel/Sheets)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders (some example files):

```
/sql/  
    └── milestone1_queries.sql  
    └── milestone2_queries.sql  
    (additional SQL files added as milestones progress)

/code/  
    └── analysis_script.R  
    └── visualization_code.R  
    (R scripts for cleaning, analysis, and visualization)

/docs/  
    └── notes.md  
    (optional documentation, planning notes, or milestone drafts)

> **Note:** Raw datasets are *not* included in this repository in accordance with project guidelines. All data files are stored securely outside GitHub (e.g., OU OneDrive).

## Project Description
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in a major metropolitan area. The company offers two rider types—casual riders and annual members—and seeks to understand how their usage patterns differ. This analysis supports the broader business question:

**How do casual riders and annual members differ in their bike usage behavior, and how can these differences inform strategies to increase annual memberships?**

Throughout the project, we progressively:
- Define the business context and analytical focus  
- Prepare and clean the data using SQL  
- Explore and visualize usage patterns  
- Develop insights and recommendations for stakeholders
